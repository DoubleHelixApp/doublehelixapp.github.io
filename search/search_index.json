On Debian based distro it's likely the version of <code>libqt6waylandclient6</code> or one of its dependencies is too old and the python module for Qt is trying to fetch some symbols from it that were added in a subsequent version. You can try to run a <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code> but if that doesn't work unfortunately you need to upgrade the Qt version manually, use another distribution (or stick with the CLI once it will be available). Something else does not work on Linux/DoubleHelix is not starting on Linux DoubleHelix is tested almost exclusively on Windows for the time being. On Windows all the executables needed beside DoubleHelix are shipped with another PyPI package upon which DoubleHelix depends. Installing through <code>pip</code> is hence sufficient to get <code>DoubleHelix</code> working. On Linux <code>DoubleHelix</code> expects all the executables to be available under <code>PATH</code>. Consequently there are dependencies that need to be installed manually. The installation section provide the dependencies list for Debian-based distros, on other distros the command may change. Fetching existing executables from <code>PATH</code> means DoubleHelix will have no control no control over the version of the dependencies. Ubuntu on WLS is using a fairly old build of samtools for example. This means some feature (i.e., FASTA conversion) won't work. This will change in the future once DoubleHelix will stop relying on distro executables but frankly this is not a priority at the moment. You're anyway more than welcome to open an issue if something is not working correctly. Windows defender is complaining a lot when launching the pyinstaller distribution, potentially uploading the .exe to the cloud for virus scanning or straight up detecting the binary as a malware Windows defender is not very happy with unsigned executables. You can rest assured DoubleHelix do not contain any malware though. DoubleHelix is completely open-source and the way the pyinstaller build is made can be seen in these GitHub Actions: Windows, Linux. One of the long-term goal is to get a certificate and start signing the binary but this won't happen anytime soon."},{"location":"#configuration","title":"Configuration","text":"<p>WGSE utilizes two configuration files to define its operational settings.

In this case, some actions may fail. Please feel free to open a bug report if that happens.</p>"},{"location":"advanced-topics/#how-it-works","title":"How it works","text":"<p>The identification can work in two different ways, depending on the information available in the alignment-map file: </p> <ul> <li>Using MD5 of sequences </li> <li>Using lengths of sequences</li> </ul> <p>MD5 indicates an MD5 string calculated in a reliable way (that accounts for case differences inside the sequence) over the content of a sequence. The procedure to calculate the MD5 is described on page 6 of the SAM standard. An MD5 can identify unequivocally a specific sequence and it's the preferred method to find a reference. If MD5 of the reference sequences are available it's easy to find the reference looking in the meta-data list of reference genomes that DoubleHelix maintains. Lengths are used only as a fallback when MD5s are not available. Unfortunately, this situation is the most common one. Despite MD5 sequences being part of the SAM specification standard they are not mandatory. Most alignment-map files won't have this field populated.</p> <p>The lengths indicate the length of the sequences expressed in base pairs. A length itself cannot reliably identify a sequence as it's possible (and happening in practices) to have the same lengths for sequences having completely different content (and hence a different MD5). What's more reliable is to use the whole set of sequences to identify a reference. The sequence of lengths contained in a reference is pretty unique for each reference, and it's the current way used by DoubleHelix to identify a reference when the MD5 is not available. It's still possible that two references have a perfectly identical set of lengths having a different sequence of MD5s. In this case, if the alignment-map file was associated by DoubleHelix to a reference falling in this situation, DoubleHelix will present a choice to the user. Since it's impossible to reliably determine which reference was used without other information, the user has to choose which reference is the correct one.</p> <p>This is a list of ambiguous lengths sequences (will be updated at  every commit)</p> <ol> <li>https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/analysisSet/hg38.analysisSet.fa.gz</li> <li> <p>https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/archive/old_genbank/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz</p> </li> <li> <p>https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-55/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.55.dna.toplevel.fa.gz</p> </li> <li>https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-56/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.56.dna.toplevel.fa.gz</li> </ol>"},{"location":"advanced-topics/#add-a-new-reference","title":"Add a new reference","text":"<p>It's possible to onboard a new reference to DoubleHelix either by opening a GitHub issue with this template or by using the following code:</p> <pre><code>manager = RepositoryManager()\nmanager.genomes.append(\n    manager.ingest(\n        \"https://source/reference.fa\",\n        \"NIH\", # Anything that matches an entry in sources.json, otherwise add an entry there\n        \"38\",  # Only 38 or 19\n    )\n)\nGenomeMetadataLoader().save(manager.genomes)\n</code></pre> <p>A GUI/CLI way will be added in the future.</p>"},{"location":"advanced-topics/#progress-bar","title":"Progress bar","text":"<p>TBD</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/","title":"User guide","text":"<p>This page explains the main window of DoubleHelix.
