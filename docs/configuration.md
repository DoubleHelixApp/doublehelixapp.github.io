# Data folder

The data folder is located in the user's home directory, `~/.helix` on Linux and `C:\Users\<username>\.helix` on Windows.

It contains three subfolders: `genomes`, `logs`, and `temp`:

- *genomes*: contains reference genome data downloaded from the internet.
- *logs*: contains log files generated by the program. Please make sure to attach these logs when reporting an issue.
- *temp*: contains temporary files used during the execution of the program. It's safe to delete it when the program is closed. Features to auto-cleanup this folder will be added in the future.

## Configuration file
DoubleHelix utilizes a configuration file to define its operational settings. These files provide a way to customize the software's behavior without modifying the code.

The configuration file is located in `main.ini` under the data folder. It's created automatically during the first startup of the program and normally it doesn't need to be modified manually.

### Configuration file sample

```ini
[general]
last_path = .

[external]
root = 3rd_party
threads = 24

[repository]
repository = repository
metadata = repository\metadata
temporary = repository\temp

[alignment_stats]
skip = 40000
samples = 20000
